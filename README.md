1. Sequence Playback: The game starts by lighting up one of the colors and playing a corresponding sound.
2. Player Response: The player must then repeat the sequence by pressing the buttons in the same order.
3. Increasing Difficulty: With each successful round, the game adds another color to the sequence, making it progressively harder.
4. Game Over: If the player presses the wrong button or fails to repeat the sequence correctly, the game ends, and the player typically hears a distinct error sound.
